These backgrounds are designed for RPG Maker MV, but can be used in any application. 

If you have Photoshop or comparable graphics software, you can place a battlebacks2 layer above any of the battlebacks1 layers to mix and match your favorite upper areas and floors! 

The only exceptions are the portal 'on' and 'off' scenes, which are best used on their own.


Thank you for your purchase!
